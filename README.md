## Stripe Donation Form

### Description

This is a simple example showing how to accept donations directly from your website using [Stripe](http://stripe.com). Note: This is meant to help you get started, not to be the final product. You should add server-side validation. **Idealy, you would be using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to import the most recent version of Stripe's PHP SDK, but for simplicity, the library is included.**
